pdftk (1.45-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The syntax for page rotation has changed: Instead of N, S, E, W, L, R and D,
  you need to use: north, south, east, west, left, right and down.

pdftk (1.44-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Since the 1.43+dfsg-1 release, the dump_data, dump_data_fields and
  update_info operations used UTF-8 encoding instead of XML numerical
  entities for non-ascii characters.

  Now the old behaviour is restored: The dump_data, dump_data_fields and
  update_info_utf operations use XML numerical entities again.
  UTF-8 encoding is now supported by the alternative operations dump_data_utf8,
  dump_data_fields_utf8 and update_info_utf8. See the pdftk(1) man page for
  more information.
